	What is the on-boarding process like?
	
	What are the best things about working in this company? (What do you like most about working here?)
	
	Timings, Work-Life Balance?
	
	Tell HR that once I have offer letter I can go for NP and join 1 month after that. 
	wait after HRs discussion and if they don't provide letter within 2 days u should ask them
	Keep taking updates with HR till offer letter is sent
	
	Depends on offer in hand...koi offer hoga to uske uper 2-3Lakh bol do, Nhi to 10.5-11
	
	HR me to salary structure and fixed amount puchh lena
	
	PF ka ki sara PF salary me se jayega ya half
	 
	joining bonus
	
	Ctc and extra benefits + ask hr ki in hand kitna ayega... Sbse imp h.. bcz sbka apna apna deduction hota h
	
	Future opportunities
	
	And promotions/salary hike me koi limits and restrictions (Like cdac.. ki max 10% hi hoga ya kuch)
	
	Probation period and notice period bhi pta kr lena
	

	CTC goes to 14 as Accenture has 21% variable portion
	ask for 12, Bcuz first switch and u have stability of 3.7 yrs


	CTC = Gross Salary + PF + Gratuity
	Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Other Allowances
	Net Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Allowances - Income Tax - Employer's Provident Fund - Professional Tax

	LINKED LIST - NODES MAY BE STORED AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, UNLIKE AN ARRAY WHERE THEY ARE STORED IN CONTIGUOUS MEMORY LOCATIONS
	
	LINKED LIST VS ARRAY
	PROS:
	SIZE CAN BE CHANGED DYNAMICALLY
	INSERTION & DELETION OF NODES IS FASTER THAN FOR ARRAY
	
	CONS:
	ONLY SEQUENTIAL ACCESS
	MORE MEORY REQ. PER NODE (TO STORE THE POINTERS)
