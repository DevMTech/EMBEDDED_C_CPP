	What is the project/team I am going to join working on?
	
	What is the on-boarding process like?
	
	What are the best things about working in this company? (What do you like most about working here?)
	
	Timings, Work-Life Balance?
	
	Tell HR that once I have offer letter I can go for NP and join 1 month after that. 
	wait after HRs discussion and if they don't provide letter within 2 days u should ask them
	Keep taking updates with HR till offer letter is sent
	
	Depends on offer in hand...koi offer hoga to uske uper 2-3Lakh bol do, Nhi to 10.5-11
	
	HR me to salary structure and fixed amount puchh lena
	
	PF ka ki sara PF salary me se jayega ya half
	 
	joining bonus
	
	Ctc and extra benefits + ask hr ki in hand kitna ayega... Sbse imp h.. bcz sbka apna apna deduction hota h
	
	Future opportunities
	
	And promotions/salary hike me koi limits and restrictions (Like cdac.. ki max 10% hi hoga ya kuch)
	
	Probation period and notice period bhi pta kr lena
	

	CTC goes to 14 as Accenture has 21% variable portion
	ask for 12, Bcuz first switch and u have stability of 3.7 yrs


	CTC = Gross Salary + PF + Gratuity
	Gross Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Other Allowances
	Net Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + Allowances - Income Tax - Employer's Provident Fund - Professional Tax

[Google]
I spend most of my time writing lower level C code (sometimes assembly code as needed), OS kernel code, browsing driver code bases, reading IP specs, reverse engineering and spreading the learnings with my teammates :)

[Intel]
I worked as a Embedded Software Engineer, implementing drivers and stack for Bluetooth (Primarily  in C and Python). I've also coded firmware modules (memory manager and some math algorithms) for a GNSS chip during my internship at Intel. And, lately I've been studying the Bluetooth RF chain and developing a software tool to control the RF Peripheral registers of the controller discretely. I am comfortable working both with software and hardware design/development.

I am personally interested in Hardware-Software co-design/development for solutions which need to be scalable, fast and maintainable using RISCV/ARM, FPGA(verilog/system verilog), Linux and C (or assembly, C++, Python). I am comfortable working with huge code bases. I like working in teams and on projects that involve a multi-disciplinary touch (System level, Hardware level, firmware level etc).

[Others]
I spend most of my free time digging into Software-Hardware Design. You can browse through few of my projects (put on github):

1. 32 Bit MIPS Processor design and Implementation for DE1Soc FPGA (under active development): Implements the minimum MIPS ISA for a 32 bit single cycle processor. git: https://github.com/pitankar/mips-cpu

2. OS Implementation for a 32 bit ARM Controller (under active development): Implements a scheduler 
for ARM Cortex M4 processors in C. git: https://github.com/pitankar/arm-rtos

3. Random Hardware design implementation for FPGA: git: https://github.com/pitankar/FPGA-Designs
